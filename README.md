# Centralized Single Node Blockchain in Python
_Developed by Andrew Dykema for Python 3.9.6+_

## Why did I choose to build this?
Because I love it! No, but more seriously I chose this project for myself as an exercise working with the data structures, designs, best practices and workflows which are present while working with blockchain technology. Starting back in early 2017, when I first became infatuated with Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency space, I was constantly reading about exploring the new developments and inventions created and built upon this new foundational blockchain paradigm. This was back when I was in high school, so at this point I had very little programming knowledge or skill outside of the Java basics class I took junior year. Later on into 2019, when I was accepted in the UMass' Computer Science program, I gained loads of programming skills, experience, and confidence all while keeping up with the cryptosphere. In the first semester of sophomore year of college, I decided to take the plunge and start to give myself some real exposure to the real technical side of blockchain now that I have a better perspective of programming and computer science. In October of 2020, I made my first commit to my first attempt at building a self-contained blockchain node.
  
## What does "Centralized Single Node" mean?
Centralized Single Node refers to where the chain exists.
